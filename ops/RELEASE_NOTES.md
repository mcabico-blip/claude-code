# RELEASE_NOTES.md — Cloud Claude → Server Claude

> Cloud Claude writes deploy-specific instructions here when pushing `production`.
> Server Claude reads this in DEPLOY.md step 0 and honors it. Keep it current;
> clear stale notes after they're applied.

## Pending for next deploy
- **Search-engine block (POC):** the build now ships `robots.txt` (Disallow /) and a
  `<meta name=robots noindex>`. Also add to the LIVE nginx vhost (server-side):
  `add_header X-Robots-Tag "noindex, nofollow" always;` (see ops/nginx.sample.conf),
  then `nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx`. Remove all three when going live for real.

## Addressed from last DEPLOY_STATUS for_cloud_claude (2026-06-15)
- ✅ Node engines relaxed to `>=20.19` (box runs node v20.20.2; Vite 6 / Nest 11
  are fine on 20.19+) — kills the EBADENGINE warning, de-risks deploys.
- ℹ️ Automation: the **timer** is localhost-only (NOT outward-facing) — safe to
  install now. Only the webhook is inbound; treat it as opt-in later.
- ✅ Restart command corrected to `systemctl restart ubi-edge` (DEPLOY.md §4 + allowlist).
- ✅ Demo login chips now hidden in production builds (gated on `import.meta.env.DEV`
  or `VITE_SHOW_DEMO_LOGINS=true`) — prod login page no longer advertises creds.
- ✅ nginx PWA hardening captured in `ops/nginx.sample.conf` for repo reference.
- ℹ️ Automation kit (timer/webhook) still NOT installed — deploys remain manual
  (owner-triggered) until you green-light standing up the webhook (outward-facing).

## Standing notes
- Demo phase: `SEED_DEMO=true` and the DB is reseedable. When real on-prem data
  arrives, flip to `SEED_DEMO=false`, stop reseeding, and rotate demo passwords.
- New env vars introduced so far: `CORS_ORIGIN`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` (optional),
  `CCTV_BASE_URL` (optional), `OAEC_BASE_URL` (optional — equipment push to Omega).
